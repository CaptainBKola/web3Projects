# web3.jsContractAccount
## Creating and deploying a contract to Rinkeby ethereum network
- This project is a practical steps towards building on ethereum network therefore;
- wallet mnemonic is not added to dot.env file
- The compile file contains code snippet that enables us to compile our solidity to bytecode and ABI
- This compile file was aimed to similate what a compiler such as redis does under the hood
- The deploy file contains code snippets that enables us deploy to rinkeby network. 
- you need to set up infura account and create a project to get api endpoint that your contract will be deployed to.
- You need to setup a metamask account and enable rinkeby account 
- Rinkeby is a testing network different from the main network
- Since deployment uses gas so get free ether from Rinkeby
- As at now, no test was carried out on the solidity contract.
